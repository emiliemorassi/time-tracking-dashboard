## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass and Flexbox
- Javascript
- Webpack
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this exercise, I learn how to build a project with Webpack.
First time using Sass, I liked it a lot.
Really easy to go back to parts of code I have not seen for a while and not get lost.
Also first time doing simple manipulation of the DOM with Javascript in a project.
I did a first try (see previous commits) with really simple js. It did the job but was not very efficient. So I tried to do better, I finally used fetch with a json file et tried to access it with a promise. Took me a while, but got there in the end.
Probably a lot to do better still, but I'm glad of that step forward.

### Continued development

I got stuck with webpack configs for a long time to get the path to images right. It worked on local but I had to add a few things for it to work on github pages. Glad that's sorted.
The Sass part was cool but I'm pretty sure I can make it more efficient.
The Javascript part does not come naturally, I had to read a lot and try so many things before it finally worked.
I need to keep doing Javascript exercises of all sorts to be confortable with it.
